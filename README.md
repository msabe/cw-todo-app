This project aims to create a Jenkins pipeline to deploy web-page written Nodejs and React Frameworks on AWS Cloud Infrastructure using Ansible. Building infrastructure process is managing with control node utilizing Ansible. This infrastructure has 1 Jenkins Server (`Amazon Linux 2 AMI`) as Ansible Control Node and 3 EC2's as worker node (`Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 with High Availability`). These EC2's will be launched on AWS console. Web-page has 3 main components which are Postgresql, Nodejs, and React. Each component is serving in Docker container on EC2s dedicated for them. Postgresql is serving as Database of web-page. Nodejs controls backend part of web-side and react controls frontend side of web-page. The Web Application will be deployed using Nodejs and React framework and should be accessible via web browser from anywhere on port 3000.

In my case; first of all I launched Jenkins Server with security group allowing SSH (port 22) and HTTP (ports 80, 8080) connections. After that, I have followed the steps indicate belowðŸ‘‡

ðŸ“ŒCreate infrastructure with Terraform,
ðŸ“ŒCreate an image repository on ECR for the app,
ðŸ“Œ Build the application Docker image and push it to the same ECR repository with different tags,
ðŸ“Œ Deploy the application on AWS EC2's with Ansible,
ðŸ“Œ Make a failure stage and ensure to destroy infrastructure, ECR repo and docker images when the pipeline failed.

I used Jenkins Pipeline for building, testing, deploying and facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It worked very well with this project.
